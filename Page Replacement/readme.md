# Page Replacement Algorithms

Consider the following reference string:
> 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2, 2, 3, 5 , 7, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 2, 7, 0, 1, 5

Write a program that simulates the followig page replacement algorithms given in Chapter 9.4:
- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- Magic

The number of frames should be given by the user. The program should give the number of page faults for each page replacement algorithm.
